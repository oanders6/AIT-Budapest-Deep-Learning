To run the code for Milestone 1, connect to Google Cloud, and begin at the top of the DeelLearningProjectMilestone2 file. From there, run each cell sequentially–you will need to mount your Google Drive to your Google Colab in order to access the downloaded dataset. From there, you should be able to simply run each cell one after the next.

The process to run the code for Milestone 2 is the same as Milestone 1–make sure that all cells above the cell titled "Part 2: Model" have been run and are stored in the same session. Then, run the cells below–training will take a little while (approx. 10 mins), but should result with a test accuracy of around 8.8%.
